This web-app concept is part of a project that aimed to predict COVID deaths in nursing homes based on a wide variety of features provided by the US Governemnt. We hypothesized incorrectly that the overall safety, sanitation, and operational efficiency of a nursing home was indicative of how COVID affected each specific nursing homes. With the data we had available there was not enough evidence to disprove the null hypothesis; however, we concluded that any information relating to COVID is still an important decision-making tool for people looking to find a safe nursing home for their loved ones.')\n",
